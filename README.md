Data exchange between native Android code and a WebView enables the development of mobile applications that combine native features with web-based content. In this example, the user from the native Android code sends two integer numbers to the WebView. Within the WeView, the user performs an addition operation on these numbers, and result is returned back
and displayed within the native application. This process can be further customized according to specific requirements, allowing for adjustments in visual appearance and functionalities.
